# SMART BIN

An application to monitor garbage bins

## Getting Started

We Named our Project as "Smart Bin" which is basically IoT based mobile app connected with smart bin for this Waste Management system. **A smart bin**, which measure the amount of trash and does two things, one is that it will send a **notification** to once it is filled, another it stores the same in the database 

And Also A Mobile app will be helpful in this types of scenarios, as it can help us to notify the level of filled trash cans and also to monitor the areas where the trash cans are filled quickly and to rectify that problem. The reports generated will be stored in a regular manner which will be useful for future analytics.
